# 8_Puzzle_Solver
An 8 Puzzle Solver Using Informed and Uninformed Search Algorithms.

## Problem Statement
```R
Given an initial state of the board, the search problem is to find a sequence of moves that
transitions this state to the goal state; that is, the configuration with all tiles arranged in ascending
order 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.
```

## Algorithms Used
```R
  - BFS
  - DFS
  - A*
```


## Results
```R
(a) path to goal
(b) cost of path
(c) nodes expanded
(d) search depth
(e) running time
```
